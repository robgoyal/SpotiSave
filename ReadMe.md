## SpotiSave

### Purpose

A command line program designed to export all my saved Spotify songs to a CSV file for easy viewing.

### Functionality

The initial functionality of this project will focus solely on saving the songs. It will be set with a cron task to update the CSV file with new songs added.

Future iterations might include ability to remove subsets of songs, saving new songs, and other functions.
